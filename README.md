### Project Overview
 Adidas Sales Dashboard (Excel)  Interactive Excel dashboard analyzing Adidas global sales to uncover profitability insights. Visualizes revenue by region, category, and retailer — helping identify top performers, reduce excess inventory, and improve marketing efficiency.

### Project Objective

 Adidas needed a clear and data-driven way to understand its global sales performance across regions, product categories, and retailers.
The challenge was that raw sales data in Excel made it difficult to quickly identify top-performing products, profit trends, and regional revenue differences.

- This project aims to analyze and visualize sales data to answer key business questions:

- Which regions and retailers generate the highest sales and profit?

- How do sales and profit vary by product category (Footwear, Apparel, Accessories)?

- What are the monthly sales trends and seasonal patterns driving performance?

The outcome is an interactive Excel dashboard that enables real-time insight into sales performance, supporting better inventory planning, marketing strategy, and revenue growth decisions.

### Data Processing Steps

1. Data Collection & Importation
   - The Adidas sales dataset was imported into Excel from a CSV file containing key fields such as region, retailer, product category, units sold, operating profit, and total sales.

2. Data Cleaning
   - Removed duplicates to ensure accuracy.
   - Standardized product category and region names for uniformity.

3. Data Transformation
   - Added calculated fields such as Profit Margin, Revenue per Unit Sold, and Year-Month for time-based trend analysis.

4. Data Analysis
   - Used Pivot Tables to summarize sales and profit performance by region, product category, and retailer.
   - Applied conditional formatting and KPI indicators to highlight high-performing areas and declining trends.
   - Created measures to track monthly sales performance, top 10 retailers, and category profitability.
     
5. Data Visualization & Dashboard Design
   - Built interactive charts and slicers to allow users to filter by region, product type, or retailer.
   - Integrated dynamic visuals (bar charts, line graphs, and KPIs) for at-a-glance performance monitoring.
   - Designed a clean, branded dashboard layout that emphasizes readability and business impact.

### Key Insights & Recommendations

   - Identified top-performing regions and retailers, providing a clear focus for strategic partnerships and targeted marketing efforts in high-revenue areas.
   - Observed noticeable sales spikes during specific months, revealing strong seasonal demand patterns that can guide future promotional campaigns, stock replenishment, and staffing decisions.

   - Uncovered underperforming categories and regions, offering opportunities to optimize inventory distribution and reduce excess supply costs.
   - Enhanced overall visibility into sales and profit metrics, enabling data-driven decisions that can increase revenue and operational efficiency.
   - California ($60.17M) and Florida ($59.28M) ranked as the top-performing states, together contributing over 20% of total U.S. sales.
   - Colorado ($21M) and Georgia ($19M) showed strong growth, highlighting opportunities for targeted promotions and retail expansion.
   - Arkansas, Delaware, and Connecticut recorded lower sales (<$13M), revealing underpenetrated markets that could benefit from increased marketing visibility.
   - Across sales channels, In-store ($356.64M) led performance, followed by Outlet ($295.59M) and Online ($247.67M) — indicating physical retail remains a strong revenue driver while e-commerce shows growing potential.
